   *9:00 - 10:00* -- Michaela Klauck

**Keynote abstract:**
In this keynote, the speaker will address topics on robotics at Bosch and especially Bosch Research.
We establish a theoretical background on quality of software-intensive products, talk about learnings and best practices along the typical robot SW stack, learn about an example for classical model-checking with Spin in robotics software, and discuss the why and how of ROS at Bosch.


**Bio. Michaela Klauck** is a research engineer at Bosch Research in Renningen.
Her mission it to make the behavior of autonomous systems (e.g., cars or robots) more reliably and robust.
In addition, trustworthiness and explainability of AI systems is of utmost important to her and she believe that formal verification provides important support to achieve these goals.
Her focus lies in the verification of planning and decision-making in autonomous systems.
She is working on model-checking robotic deliberation and autonomous driving behavior.
Therefore, She is associated with the robotics and autonomous driving portfolios at Bosch Research.

Previously, she has been a research associate at the chair of Prof. Holger Hermanns, Dependable Systems and Software Group at Saarland University, since November 2017, where she has been working in the area of quantitative verification, especially at the interface of these topics to automatic planning and the AI community, e.g., by performing quality analysis of neural network decision making agents in autonomous driving scenarios.
In June 2022, she successfully defended my PhD (Dr.-Ing.) thesis "On the Connection of Probabilistic Model Checking, Planning, and Learning for System Verification".
