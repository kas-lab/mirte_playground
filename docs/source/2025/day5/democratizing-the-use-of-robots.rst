**Keynote:** Democratizing the use of robots

   *9:00 - 10:30* -- Patrizio Pelliccione

**Keynote abstract:**
Autonomous systems and robots promise to facilitate a myriad of tasks of everyday life.
Software engineering is called to play a key role in making robotic research pervasive and ubiquitous and in democratizing the use of robots in everyday-life scenarios.
There is the need of rethinking the development processes, as well as the architecting, designing and integration of robotic software.
In this talk, I will describe our experience in making robots accessible to people with expertise neither in ICT nor in robotics.
Specifically, I will describe our solutions to enable the specification of complex missions for multi-robots in a user-friendly but still accurate and unambiguous way.
I will close the talk with a view of future research and development directions.
