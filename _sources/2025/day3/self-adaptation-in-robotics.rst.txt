Self-adaptation in Robotics
***************************
   *13:30 - 15:00* -- Ilias Gerostathopoulos

In this lecture we will look at what self-adaptive systems are and why they exist.
We will delve into two examples of self-adaptive robotics systems to get some intuition over the theory and the definitions.
We will then look at the interplay between software architecture and self-adaptation.
Finally, we will discuss an important recent paper on task plan and architecture self-adaptation for robotics, as an example of state of the art research in this field.
