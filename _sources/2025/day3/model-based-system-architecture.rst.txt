Model-based system Architecture (Tutorial)

   *11:00 - 12:30* -- Carlos Hernandez Corbato

Model-based Systems Engineering (MBSE) is an approach to systems engineering that uses a single, integrated, consistent and coherent formal model to support requirements, design, analysis, verification, and validation activities throughout the system's development lifecycle.
In this tutorial session, we will learn to use SE and MBSE practices to design the architecture of a robotic application, with a functional focus.
We will work together on obtaining the functional flow of a robotic system, given a description of its operational scenario and an N-square chart of its functional interfaces.

**Bio. Carlos Hernandez Corbato** is Associate Professor at the Cognitive Robotics Department in the Faculty Mechanical Engineering of TU Delft, The Netherlands.
He participates in the EU projects CoreSense, METATOOL, and REMARO, has served as scientific coordinator in other EU projects, and won with Team Delft the Amazon Robotics Challenge 2016.
His research interests include software architectures for robotics, knowledge representation and reasoning, model-based systems engineering, and self-adaptive systems, and teaches about these topics in the MSc Robotics Program.
Carlos holds MSc degrees in engineering (2006) and automation and robotics (2008), and a Ph.D (2013) from Universidad Politecnica de Madrid.
