MIRTE with PDDL (Instructions)
******************************

.. _PDDL: https://planning.wiki/guide/whatis/pddl
.. _PlanSys2: https://plansys2.github.io/
.. _nav2: https://docs.nav2.org/

During this exercise, you will learn how to use `PDDL`_ with `PlanSys2`_ to make Mirte navigate using `nav2`_.

Before we start digging in the PDDL formulation and PlanSys2, first we need to create a map of the arena to enable the robot to navigate autonomously.

.. important::

   All the commands below should be executed inside a docker container of the ``mirte_playground`` image.
   Check the :ref:`2025-mirte-docker` page for detailed instructions on how to download and run the image.

Mapping
=======

Place Mirte inside the arena, preferably close to the middle to make it easier for Mirte to move.

Start the mapping stack
-----------------------
Start the navigation stack:

.. code-block:: bash

   ros2 launch mirte_navigation real_robot_navigation.launch.py

In another terminal, start the slam toolbox:

.. code-block:: bash

   ros2 launch slam_toolbox online_async_launch.py use_sim_time:=false

Make Mirte navigate
-------------------

To make Mirte navigate, click on the ``Nav2 Goal`` button on the top part of the RVIZ screen then click on a point in the map to make it move there.

.. ![alt text](nav2goal.png)

Make Mirte move around until it maps the whole arena.
When you are satisfied with the map created, move to the next step.

Save map
--------

To save the map you just created, first you need to add the SlamToolboxPlugin to RVIZ.
For that, on the top left part of RVIZ, click on :menuselection:`Panels --> Add new panel --> SlamToolBoxPlugin`:

.. ``Panels`` > ``Add new panel`` > ``SlamToolBoxPlugin``

.. image:: images/rviz_add_slam_toolbox_plugin.png
   :alt: Add SlamToolboxPlugin panel to RVIZ

.. ![alt text](rviz_add_slam_toolbox_plugin.png)

After adding the panel, it should show up in the bottom left part of RVIZ

.. image:: images/toolbox.png
   :alt: SlamToolboxPlugin panel in RVIZ

.. ![alt text](toolbox.png)

Insert the following path in the field in front of the ``Save Map`` button and click on the button:

.. Could also use the :file:`` directive here

.. code-block:: bash

   /home/ubuntu-user/mirte_ws/src/mirte_navigation/maps/arena_map


PlanSys2
========

For this exercise, we designed a very simple scenario where Mirte should move through 3 waypoints and return to the initial position.

PDDL
----
.. [domain.pddl](https://github.com/kas-lab/mirte_playground/blob/main/mirte_pddl/pddl/domain.pddl)
.. [problem.pddl](https://github.com/kas-lab/mirte_playground/blob/main/mirte_pddl/pddl/problem.pddl)

The first thing you need to do is to modify the :2025-playground-file:`domain.pddl <mirte_pddl/pddl/domain.pddl>` and :2025-playground-file:`problem.pddl <mirte_pddl/pddl/problem.pddl>` files to model the scenario described above.

.. tip::

   Make sure you model which points were already visited and modify the action preconditions to use this knowledge.
   Also, make sure the action effects properly model the location of the robot, and its impact on the visisted waypoints knowledge.

Waypoints configuration
-----------------------
.. [waypoints.yml](https://github.com/kas-lab/mirte_playground/blob/main/mirte_pddl/config/waypoints.yml)

Update the :2025-playground-file:`waypoints.yml <mirte_pddl/config/waypoints.yml>` configuration file with coordinates that make sense for your map.
To obtain the coordinates of points in the map, you can click on the ``Publish Point`` button on the top part of RVIZ and subscribe to the ``/clicked_point`` topic to obtain the coordinates.

.. code-block:: bash

   ros2 topic echo /clicked_point

Adding more waypoints
---------------------
.. [waypoints.yml](https://github.com/kas-lab/mirte_playground/blob/main/mirte_pddl/config/waypoints.yml)
.. [move action](https://github.com/kas-lab/mirte_playground/blob/fcb49fa21600141758ce2ff98e6cbc59564cc44c/mirte_pddl/src/action_move.cpp#L49-L52)

If you want to add more waypoints, in addition to adding them to the :2025-playground-file:`waypoints.yml <mirte_pddl/config/waypoints.yml>` file, you need to declare the new waypoints in the :2025-playground-file:`move action <mirte_pddl/src/action_move.cpp#L49-L52>`.

Run PlanSys with Mirte
----------------------

**First, connect to Mirte.**

In your computer, inside the docker container, start the navigation stack:

.. code-block:: bash

   ros2 launch mirte_navigation real_robot_navigation.launch.py

In another terminal, start PlanSys2:

.. code-block:: bash

   ros2 launch mirte_pddl mirte_pddl.launch.py

.. note::
   Sometimes PlanSys2 crashes when starting, so give it another try in case it doesn't work in the first try.
