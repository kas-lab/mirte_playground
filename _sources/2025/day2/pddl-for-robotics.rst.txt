**********************************
PDDL for Task Planning in Robotics
**********************************
   *13:30 - 15:00* -- Francisco J. Rodríguez Lera

A practical session focused on the use of |PDDL| in robotics.
Real-world and simulated examples will be explored to show how robots can leverage planning with |PDDL| to perform complex tasks, integrating actions, and autonomous decision-making.
The session will also introduce PlanSys2, a ROS 2 framework for planning and execution, showcasing how it uses |PDDL| to enable goal-oriented behavior in robotic systems.

.. |PDDL| replace:: :abbr:`PDDL (Planning Domain Definition Language)`

**Bio Francisco J. Rodríguez** received his Ph.D. degree in intelligent systems for engineering in 2015 from the School of Industrial Engineering and Information Technology at University of León (Spain). Currently, he is working as a researcher in the University of León (Spain) after to stay two years as a research associate in the AI Robolab, which belongs to the Computer Science and Communications Research Unit (CSC) at University of Luxembourg. Much of his work and research interest lies on four different topics associated with AI and Robotics: cybersecurity in Autonomous Systems, in particular in Social Robots for Public Spaces; cognitive architectures motivational-oriented for robot control generating natural behaviors in autonomous robots; software development and DevOps for delivering solutions in research and business scenarios; application of AI and robots solutions for home-like environments and public spaces; and artificial neural networks systems applied to context-awareness in human-robot interaction environments.
