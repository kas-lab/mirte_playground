Preparation
===========
Instructions for preparing your setup before:
 - Please work either on a Linux distribution or in the :abbr:`WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)`
 - You need a docker installation: https://www.docker.com/get-started/
 - Clone this Git repository: https://github.com/convince-project/AS2FM (only downloading the docker container of the repo is not sufficient because we need linked files from the repo).
 - Go to the root folder of the cloned repository and check if the docker container, in which we will be working during the school, starts correctly.
   This can be done by running: ``docker compose run -it --remove-orphans base bash``.
   If no error occurs everything is installed already and you can exit the container by typing ``-d``.
 - On the verification day we will follow this tutorial: https://convince-project.github.io/AS2FM/tutorials.html.
   It is not needed to look at the tutorial beforehand.
